# Data Structures:
  * A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
# DS Classification:
 - Linear
   - e.g: Array, LinkedList, stack, queue
 - Non-Linear
   - e.g: Map, Tree, Graph

# Classfificaiton
   1. Arrays
   2. Linked List
      * Singly Linked List
      * Doubly linked list
      * Circular linked list
   3. Stack (LIFO)
   4. Queue (FIFO)
   5. Tree
      * Binary Tree
      * Binary Search Tree
      * AVL Tree
      * B-Tree
   6. Graph

# Algorithms
    -  ‚Äù A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations"



## Types of Algorithms:
  * Brute Force Algorithm
    * Without optimization try to find the solution
  * Recursive Algorithm
    * use recursion technique to make it sub problems and find solutions
  * Backtracking Algorithm
    * build solutions by searching among all solutions. When solution fails trace back to failure point
    * then build on the next solution and continue this process till we find the solution or all solution are looked after.
  * Searching Algorithm
    * searching elements
  * Sorting Algorithms
  * Hashing Algorithms:
    * index with keyid
    * key is assigned to data
  * Divide and Conquer
  * Greedy
    * solutions build part by part. The solutions for the next part is build on the immediate benefit of the next part.
    * the one solution giving most benefit chosen next
  * Dynamic Programming
  * Randomzied Algorithm
